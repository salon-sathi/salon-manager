# Salon Manager — Appointments, Billing & CRM

A single-screen salon & spa management app: **appointments, billing, customers, loyalty,
stock and accounts**. A **React + Vite** front end backed by **Firebase** (Authentication,
Realtime Database, Storage), so data syncs live across every device that signs in — the
counter tablet, the owner's phone, the back-office laptop.

Salon Manager is an adaptation of a **production-validated grocery POS**
([grocery-store-manager](https://github.com/s123dive-web/grocery-store-manager)) that has been
in daily use in a real shop. The billing, inventory, sync, import, backup and analytics engines
are **ported, not rewritten** — they arrive with their test suites intact. The salon layer
(appointments, services, staff, loyalty, reminders, commissions) is built on top.

Nothing here is branded to a particular salon: the name, address, phone, logo and payment QR
are all **editable in Settings**, so the app is reusable by any salon.

## What it does

**Front desk** — a day-view appointment diary with a column per stylist; 15-minute slots,
multi-service bookings, blocked-out time, overlap prevention, and **Complete → Bill**, which
hands the POS the customer, services and stylist pre-filled.

**Billing** — services and retail on one bill, per-line stylist attribution, barcode scanning,
UPI / Cash / Udhari (credit), amount-encoded UPI QR, back-dating, and a 3-inch thermal receipt
that names the stylist, the points earned and when the customer is next due.

**Customers** — keyed by phone, created in one tap from the till. Visit history, spend, notes,
birthdays and anniversaries, loyalty points, tiers, packages, and RFM segments (TOP / Regular /
At-risk / Dormant / New).

**Loyalty & memberships** — configurable points (earn rate, redemption value, caps), rolling
12-month tiers, and prepaid packages that redeem at the till as ₹0 lines.

**Reminders** — a daily queue built from rebooking cycles, birthdays, anniversaries, expiring
packages and dormant customers, sent as WhatsApp deep links with editable Hindi/English
templates.

**Staff** — roster, colours, commission rates, a printable monthly payout report with
line-by-line detail, and performance charts (revenue per stylist, services per day, a
peak-hour heatmap, no-show rates).

**Stock** — retail *and* backbar, with batches, expiry, FIFO depletion, low-stock and expiry
alerts, a barcode label creator, and tolerant import (txt/csv/tsv/xls/xlsx/pdf/json).

**Money** — sales history (edit, split across dates, delete), the Udhari credit ledger, vendor
bills with proof uploads, expenses, salon analytics (service vs retail split, top services,
repeat ratio, average bill trend, LTV distribution, new vs returning, no-show %, dormant trend,
reminder→visit conversion), and JSON/XLSX backup & restore.

Throughout: multi-user roles, live sync across devices, offline reads, an activity log, and a
layout that works on the phone at the counter.

## ⚠ Before it will run: connect a Firebase project

[`src/lib/firebase.js`](src/lib/firebase.js) contains a **real, committed config** — it points
at the author's project, `salon-manager-49a88`. That is deliberate (a Firebase web config is
public by design; it identifies a project, it does not grant access to it), and it is **not
usable by a fork**: `database.rules.json` locks every slice to a role registered in *that*
project, so an account you create can read nothing. **If you are running your own salon, you
must create your own Firebase project and replace the config block.**

**Salon Manager needs its OWN Firebase project.** It stores data under the same
`shop/<slice>` paths as the grocery app, so pointing both at one project would have them
overwrite each other's live data.

1. [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → **Add project**.
2. **Authentication** → Sign-in method → enable **Email/Password**.
3. **Realtime Database** → Create database (pick your region).
4. **Storage** → Get started (needed for vendor-bill proof uploads).
5. **Project settings → General → Your apps → Web app** → copy the config values into
   [`src/lib/firebase.js`](src/lib/firebase.js), replacing the whole `firebaseConfig` object.
   Every field matters, `databaseURL` included — it carries the region.
6. Deploy the security rules — **both files**, and `storage.rules` needs one edit first:
   see [Deploying the rules](#deploying-the-rules) and
   [Storage rules setup](#storage-rules-setup).
7. Sign in. **The first account to sign in claims ownership** of the salon.

If the config is blanked out or its `apiKey` isn't a Firebase browser key, the sign-in screen
says "Not connected yet" rather than failing with a cryptic `auth/invalid-api-key`. A config
that is *well-formed but somebody else's* cannot be detected client-side — that one surfaces
as permission-denied after sign-in, which is the rules doing their job.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

Other scripts: `npm run build`, `npm run preview`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format`,
`npm test` (Vitest), `npm run test:watch`.

## Roles & access control

Salon Manager is **multi-user**. The owner manages staff accounts from inside the app
(**Settings → Users**) — no Firebase console visits for day-to-day user management.

This table is the **default** for each role. Most of it is then the owner's to change from
**Settings → Users & roles → Feature access** — see [Feature access](#feature-access) below.
A ⚙ marks a row the owner can switch either way.

| Can they… | Owner | Biller | Inventory |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Billing (POS), print receipts | ✅ | ✅ ⚙ | ✅ ⚙ |
| Appointments — view, book, change status, block time | ✅ | ✅ ⚙ | ✅ ⚙ |
| Customer picker (search + quick-create) | ✅ | ✅ ⚙ | ✅ ⚙ |
| Dashboard — the shop's revenue, profit and margins | ✅ | — | — |

By default `inventory` is a strict superset of `biller` — a test enforces that, so the two
can't drift. Once an owner starts switching features per role they are simply two independent
sets, which is the point.

### Feature access

**Settings → Users & roles → Feature access** is a matrix of every switchable feature against
the two worker roles. Tick or untick, press Save, and it applies to everyone with that role on
every device — a counter tablet picks it up live, with no reload.

The choices are stored at `config.permissions` as a **sparse map of what changed from the
default**, so a shop that leaves a feature alone keeps following the default if a later version
improves it. Nothing is written per user: the switches are per role.

**What the panel refuses to offer is the interesting part.** `database.rules.json` hard-codes
`role === 'owner'` on the sensitive nodes, so a toggle for (say) Expenses would open a screen
whose every read comes back permission-denied — a switch that looks like it worked and then
fails at the counter. `GRANTABLE` in [`roles.js`](src/lib/roles.js) is therefore the envelope,
derived from the rules, and `can()` **intersects with it** — so even a `permissions` blob
hand-edited into the Firebase console cannot grant what the rules would refuse. The features
that can never be delegated are listed in the panel *with the reason*, rather than being
quietly absent. An owner is never restricted by any of this, which is what stops a setting from
costing the last owner their own shop.

Adding a feature to the panel means checking the matching rule in `database.rules.json` first,
then adding the action to `GRANTABLE`. `src/permissions.integration.test.jsx` mounts the real
app per role and pins all of the above.

**Enforced in two layers**, and both matter:

1. **UI** — [`src/lib/roles.js`](src/lib/roles.js) is the single source of truth for
   `can(role, action, permissions)`. Navigation renders by role, and **every gated view
   re-checks its own permission**: hiding a button is not a control, because the active tab is
   just state. Role is resolved from `shop/users/<uid>` *before* the app shell renders, so a
   worker never sees an owner-only view flash past on a slow connection. The owner's per-role
   feature switches are the third argument — they can only move a permission *inside* what
   layer 2 already allows.
2. **Server** — [`database.rules.json`](database.rules.json) re-derives the role from
   `shop/users/<uid>` and enforces it at the database. This is the real boundary.

The client also **never subscribes to a slice its role cannot read**, so a worker's session
doesn't spray permission-denied errors at the counter.

### Deploying the rules

```bash
# one-time: install the CLI and sign in
npm i -g firebase-tools && firebase login

# edit the owner allowlist in storage.rules first (see below), then:
firebase deploy --only database,storage
```

- [`database.rules.json`](database.rules.json) — role-based, per-slice. No email to edit:
  ownership is claimed by the first sign-in.
- [`storage.rules`](storage.rules) — vendor-bill proofs. **Needs one edit before it works** —
  see [Storage rules setup](#storage-rules-setup) directly below.
- [`firebase.json`](firebase.json) — points the CLI at both rule files.

> Until the rules are deployed, the database is only as safe as whatever rules are currently
> live in the console. Treat deploying them as part of setup, not an optional extra.

### Storage rules setup

[`storage.rules`](storage.rules) ships with a **placeholder owner email** and will not work
until you replace it. There is exactly one line to change — the allowlist inside `isOwner()`,
at the top of the file:

```
function isOwner() {
  return request.auth != null
    && request.auth.token.email in ['OWNER_EMAIL_1'];   // ← your sign-in email
}
```

Two owners? Make it a two-element list: `['a@x.com', 'b@x.com']`. Every rule that needs "is
this the owner?" calls `isOwner()`, so no email appears anywhere else in the file.

Then deploy:

```bash
firebase deploy --only storage
```

**Why an email here when the database uses roles.** Storage rules *cannot read the Realtime
Database*. There is a `firestore.get()` cross-service call but no RTDB equivalent, so the
`shop/users/<uid>/role` lookup that `database.rules.json` performs is simply not expressible
in a Storage rule. The honest alternatives are an email allowlist or custom auth claims, and
claims need a backend / the Admin SDK — out of scope for an app with no server. Vendor bills
are owner-only anyway, so the allowlist costs nothing in practice: the set of people allowed
to touch proofs is exactly {the owner}.

**Deployed unedited, the failure is quiet.** Nobody matches `'OWNER_EMAIL_1'`, so every proof
upload and every attempt to open one fails with `storage/unauthorized` — which reads in the
app as "Upload failed", not as "a rules file still has a placeholder in it". Customer receipts
(`shop/receipts/**`) are unaffected: they are public-read and staff-write, with no email in
the rule.

### Bootstrap: how the first owner is created

While `shop/users` is empty, the first authenticated user **self-registers as owner** — both
the app and the rules implement this. Once anyone is registered, the node locks down and only
an owner can add users. So: **create the owner's Firebase Auth account and sign in with it
first**, before adding anyone else.

The owner can't lock themselves out: demoting or deactivating the **last active owner** is
refused, because there would be nobody left who can manage users and no console-free way back.

### What the role system does and does not protect

Be clear-eyed about this. The Realtime Database enforces rules **per node**, and the POS
cannot function without reading `sales`, `customers`, `items` and `services`. So:

- ✅ **Genuinely protected, server-side.** Expenses, vendor bills, and the daily-bills slice
  are unreadable to workers. Settings, the service menu, prices, commission rates, package
  definitions and the user registry are **read-only** to workers. A saved bill is
  **write-once for a worker** — `shop/sales/$id` allows a create and nothing else, so editing,
  splitting and deleting are all owner-only by rule rather than merely hidden. Restore
  requires a whole-tree write the rules deny to non-owners.
- ⚠ **A UI control, not a boundary.** Workers can read `sales` because the POS needs it, so a
  technically skilled worker could open the browser console and derive revenue totals from
  raw data. Likewise "create a customer but don't browse the customer list" is a UI
  restriction: RTDB cannot express field-level or query-shaped read limits, so `customers` is
  readable to anyone who can bill.

True isolation would need a backend API in front of the database (Cloud Functions or a
server), which is out of scope. The role system is an **operational control** over what staff
can do and see in normal use, **plus rule-enforced protection of the genuinely sensitive
slices** — money, settings, user management, and deletions.

The Feature access switches sit squarely in the first category and inherit its limits exactly:
they change what the app offers, never what the database permits. That is also why they cannot
*grant* anything past the rules — the envelope is the same boundary described above.

## How data is stored

Data lives in the **Firebase Realtime Database** and syncs **live across every signed-in
device**. Each record is stored under its own keyed node — `shop/<slice>/<id>` — so concurrent
edits to different records from different devices merge instead of clobbering each other;
writes are field-level deltas, and incoming cloud snapshots are 3-way merged with any
un-pushed local edits. See [`src/lib/sync.js`](src/lib/sync.js) (covered by
[`src/lib/sync.test.js`](src/lib/sync.test.js)).

| Slice | Holds |
|---|---|
| `users/<uid>` | email, name, role, active — **the access-control registry** |
| `customers/<phone>` | keyed by phone; name, dob, anniversary, tags, denormalized visit/spend/points stats |
| `services/<id>` | name, category, duration, price, commission %, rebook cycle |
| `staff/<id>` | name, colour, role, default commission % |
| `appointments/<id>` | date, staff, start, duration, services, status, linked bill |
| `sales/<id>` | bills — with customer, per-line staff attribution, points, packages |
| `items/<id>` | retail **and** backbar stock, with batches/expiry |
| `packages`, `customerPackages` | package definitions and what each customer has left |
| `messageTemplates/<id>` | reminder templates (Hindi + English) |
| `expenses`, `vendorBills`, `logs` | accounts and the activity trail |
| `config` | salon identity + loyalty rules (a singleton, not a keyed slice) |

A `localStorage` cache (key `slm-cache-v1`) gives instant first paint and offline reads, and is
flushed on tab close/hide. **It only caches slices the signed-in role may read** — a counter
tablet is a shared device, and an owner's session must not leave the expense book on disk for
whoever signs in next. Vendor-bill **proof files** live in Firebase Storage
([`src/lib/bills.js`](src/lib/bills.js)); only metadata and a download URL go in the database.

> **Back up regularly** from the sidebar — **⬇ JSON** or **⬇ XLSX**, and **⬆ Restore** accepts
> either. ⚠ **Restore replaces all data and that change syncs to the cloud**, so it overwrites
> every signed-in device, not just this one. Export a fresh backup first. Owner only.

## First run & seed data

On first run — and **only** while a slice is still empty — the app seeds itself so it is usable
immediately, then never overwrites that data again. A salon that has edited its own prices will
not have them reset by a redeploy.

- **~80 services** across Hair / Skin / Nails / Spa / Makeup, men's and women's, at typical
  Pune mid-market prices, with durations and sensible rebooking cycles.
- **34 products**, split `retail` (resold over the counter) and `backbar` (consumed during a
  service). Everything starts at **0 stock** so the salon counts its real opening stock in.
- **2 sample stylists**, so the appointment grid has columns on day one.
- **10 reminder templates** — Hindi and English, for rebooking, birthdays, anniversaries,
  win-backs and expiring packages.
- **No customers.** That data is real or it is nothing.

All of it is editable in-app, and lives in [`src/lib/seed.js`](src/lib/seed.js) as pure,
tested data (no clock, no randomness).

## Architecture

- **`src/salon-manager.jsx`** — the app shell: sign-in, the role gate, sync wiring, the nav and
  the view switch.
- **`src/views/*.jsx`** — one screen per file, each loaded on demand (`React.lazy`), so the
  counter tablet downloads the till and the diary rather than the whole app.
- **`src/components/*.jsx`**, **`src/lib/ui/*.js`** — what more than one screen shares: the
  receipt, the customer picker, the chart scaffolding, the stylesheet, the theme.
- **`src/lib/*.js`** — pure, unit-tested logic. No React, no Firebase (except the thin
  `firebase.js` / `sync.js` / `bills.js` adapters).

| Module | What it does | Tests |
|---|---|---|
| [`sync.js`](src/lib/sync.js) | keyed-node storage, field-level deltas, 3-way merge, role-aware slice reads | ✅ |
| [`roles.js`](src/lib/roles.js) | the `can(role, action, permissions)` matrix, plus the envelope the owner may switch features inside | ✅ |
| [`seed.js`](src/lib/seed.js) | first-run service menu, stock, staff, templates | ✅ |
| [`customers.js`](src/lib/customers.js) | phone normalisation (the customer key) + drift-free visit/spend stats | ✅ |
| [`salon.js`](src/lib/salon.js) | service/staff validation, commission rate resolution, bill-line types | ✅ |
| [`appointments.js`](src/lib/appointments.js) | the overlap check, grid layout, booking validation | ✅ |
| [`loyalty.js`](src/lib/loyalty.js) | points maths, tiers, prepaid packages | ✅ |
| [`reminders.js`](src/lib/reminders.js) | the reminder queue, WhatsApp deep links, RFM segments | ✅ |
| [`commissions.js`](src/lib/commissions.js) | payouts, per-stylist performance, peak hours, no-show rates | ✅ |
| [`stats.js`](src/lib/stats.js) | revenue/profit series, heatmaps, break-even, salon analytics | ✅ |
| [`parse.js`](src/lib/parse.js) | tolerant import parser (txt/csv/tsv/xls/xlsx/pdf/json) | ✅ |
| [`backup.js`](src/lib/backup.js) | JSON/XLSX backup & restore | ✅ |
| [`barcodes.js`](src/lib/barcodes.js) | Code 128 / EAN-13 generation and matching | ✅ |
| [`dailyBills.js`](src/lib/dailyBills.js) | carried over from the grocery core; **not mounted** — see below | ✅ |
| [`bills.js`](src/lib/bills.js) | vendor-bill proof upload to Firebase Storage | — |
| [`firebase.js`](src/lib/firebase.js) | SDK init + the secondary app used to create users | — |

`dailyBills.js` and its suite are kept intact so a grocery-era backup still restores, and so
the section could be revived without rewriting its validated mappers — but Salon Manager does
not ship the Daily-Need Bills view. A salon's consumable purchases go through **Vendor Bills**.

Money is handled in **paise-rounded rupees** and dates in the **local timezone**, using the
helpers the grocery app already hardened — don't reintroduce bugs those fixed.

### Nothing that matters is a running total

Customer visit counts, total spend, loyalty points, tier and package sessions are all
**derived from the bills** and recomputed, never incremented.

This is the single most important invariant in the app. An incremented counter drifts the first
time a bill is deleted, edited on another device, or merged twice — and each of those drifts is
a real argument at the counter: a points balance nobody can adjudicate, a package session
either given away twice or refused to someone entitled to it. Deriving them means **the
delete-reversal is automatic — there is no reversal code to forget.**

The cost is one pass over an in-memory array; the reconcilers return the *same array reference*
when nothing changed, so they settle in one pass rather than writing to the cloud on every
render.

**`Admin → Recompute customer stats, points & packages`** is the escape hatch. It rebuilds all
of it from the bills, and it tells you up front how many records currently look out of step —
normally zero, because the app reconciles as it goes. It matters after a **restore**, or after
data has been touched outside the app, where "as it goes" never ran. Since the bills are the
source of truth, it can only ever correct these figures — it cannot lose anything.

Two knowing simplifications, both in [`loyalty.js`](src/lib/loyalty.js):

- Points are earned on what the customer actually **pays** (after a points redemption), not on
  the pre-redemption total — otherwise points would earn points.
- A package covers **one session per bill line**. Adding a second of the same service to one
  bill bumps the quantity at the package's zero price rather than drawing a second session.

### Commissions: what the salon pays its people

A quiet bug here becomes a wage dispute, so two rules are fixed in
[`commissions.js`](src/lib/commissions.js):

- **Commission is read off the bill, never recomputed from today's rates.** Every service line
  snapshots its `commissionPct` at the moment of sale. Raise the colour rate in August and
  July's payout does not silently reprice — a report that changes when you re-open it is a
  report nobody can trust.
- **A discount is the salon's decision, not the stylist's.** Commission is computed on the line
  amount, *before* any whole-bill discount or points redemption. Netting the discount off their
  commission would quietly make every discount come half out of the stylist's pocket.

Two consequences worth knowing: a **package redemption bills at ₹0 and so earns ₹0** here (that
session's commission was earned when the package was sold), and the **peak-hour heatmap is built
from appointments, not bills** — a bill is stamped when the customer *pays*, which is when they
leave, not when they were in the chair.

The no-show rate's denominator is appointments that **resolved** (completed + no-show).
Cancellations are excluded: a customer who rings ahead is being considerate, and counting that
against the stylist would be perverse.

### Reminders: how the salon contacts people

The failure mode of this feature is **pestering real customers**, so two rules are enforced in
[`reminders.js`](src/lib/reminders.js) rather than left to the UI:

1. **Never invent a reason.** Every row is derived from the bills — a service whose rebooking
   cycle has landed, a birthday, a package about to lapse. A customer who has never visited is
   never called dormant; a one-off service (bridal makeup) never generates "you're due another".
2. **One message per customer per day.** Someone who is simultaneously due a haircut, having a
   birthday and holding an expiring package gets **one** message — the most time-critical
   reason — with the rest shown as context. Anyone contacted for the same reason in the last 30
   days is hidden by default.

**Delivery is a WhatsApp deep link that a human taps.** No WhatsApp Business API, no unofficial
libraries, no automation — the app opens a chat with the message pre-filled and a person presses
send. Bulk sends open chats one at a time, staggered so pop-up blockers don't eat them. This is
a deliberate constraint, not a missing feature.

Segments (TOP / Regular / At-risk / Dormant / New) are **rule-based, not quintile-scored**: a
30-customer salon has no meaningful quintiles, and an owner can act on "hasn't been in for 90
days" in a way they can't act on "RFM score 3-4-2".

### The appointment diary

The day view is a hand-rolled CSS grid — one column per working stylist, 15-minute rows,
absolutely-positioned blocks. There is no calendar dependency; the grid *is* the layout.

Two decisions worth knowing about:

- **Time is `startMin`** — minutes since midnight, local — plus a duration, not a timestamp. A
  salon books "Tuesday at 3pm", not an instant on a global timeline, and minutes-since-midnight
  can't be shifted by a timezone or a DST boundary.
- **Overlap uses half-open intervals.** An appointment ending at 3:00 and one starting at 3:00
  do *not* clash — back-to-back is a normal busy day, and closed intervals would reject the most
  common booking pattern there is. Cancelled and no-show slots free the chair again; `blocked`
  time does not (that's the point of it).

Working hours come from **Settings** and bound the grid; a booking outside them is refused
rather than rendered off-screen.

## Deploying

Pushing to `main` builds and publishes to **GitHub Pages** via
[`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) (Node 24; runs `npm run build`
and `npm test` before publishing, and retries the Pages publish up to 3× to ride out transient
API failures). The Pages base path is set in [`vite.config.js`](vite.config.js) and must match
the repository name.

### ⚠ One-time: turn Pages on

**Repo → Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: _GitHub Actions_.**

Until that's set, every run fails at the `configure-pages` step with a **403**, *after* `npm ci`,
the build and the tests have all passed — the workflow is fine, the repository just has nowhere
to publish to. Re-run the latest workflow (or push any commit) once it's enabled.

The site then lands at `https://<user>.github.io/salon-manager/`. A fork publishes with the
committed config still in it, so it will sign in against **the author's project** and then be
denied every read — put your own project in [`src/lib/firebase.js`](src/lib/firebase.js) before
you point a salon at it (see
[Before it will run](#-before-it-will-run-connect-a-firebase-project)).

## Rules testing

[`database.rules.json`](database.rules.json) is the **real** access boundary (see
[Roles & access control](#roles--access-control)), and until now it was the one part of the
app nothing executed. [`tests/rules/`](tests/rules/) runs the actual rules file inside the
Firebase emulator and asserts, role by role, what the database really permits.

```bash
npm run test:rules
```

That command starts the emulators, runs the suite against them, and shuts them down — there
is nothing to start or stop by hand, and it never touches a real project.

**Java 11+ must be on your `PATH`.** The Realtime Database emulator is a JAR; without a JVM
the command stops with `Could not spawn 'java -version'`. Any JDK or JRE will do
([Temurin](https://adoptium.net/) is the usual choice). Everything else is already a
devDependency.

### Port map

Set in [`firebase.json`](firebase.json); change them there, not in the tests — the harness
reads the address `emulators:exec` exports and only falls back to these.

| Emulator | Port |
|---|---|
| Realtime Database | 9000 |
| Authentication | 9099 |
| Emulator UI | 4000 |
| Emulator hub (assigned by the CLI) | 4400 |

### Layout

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| [`tests/rules/setup.js`](tests/rules/setup.js) | the harness: emulator wiring, `asOwner()` / `asBiller()` / `asInventory()` / `asUnauth()`, seeding, per-test lifecycle |
| [`tests/rules/rbac.test.js`](tests/rules/rbac.test.js) | the role matrix — money slices, stock, sales, config, the user registry, POS read dependencies |
| [`tests/rules/bootstrap.test.js`](tests/rules/bootstrap.test.js) | first-owner self-registration, lockdown once claimed, unauthenticated access, last-owner lockout, deactivated users |

Fixtures are written through `withSecurityRulesDisabled`, never through the rules — seeding
through the rules would make the fixture a second, silent assertion, and a rule change would
surface as a confusing setup error instead of a failed test.

### Two constraints worth knowing before you add specs

**`npm test` does not run this suite.** The pure-lib and jsdom suites must stay runnable with
no emulator and no Java, so [`vite.config.js`](vite.config.js) excludes `tests/rules/**` and
the rules suite has its own [`vitest.rules.config.js`](vitest.rules.config.js). CI runs
`npm test` only.

**The suite is single-threaded on purpose.** The emulator is one shared, stateful process and
every spec wipes the database in `beforeEach`, so parallel spec files would delete each
other's fixtures mid-assertion. `vitest.rules.config.js` sets `fileParallelism: false` and
`maxWorkers: 1`. Don't remove either — the failures it causes are timing-dependent and look
like flaky rules rather than a config problem.

### What the suite found

- **A biller could edit an existing bill — now closed.** The rule on `shop/sales/$id` was
  `newData.exists() || role === 'owner'`, and `newData.exists()` only separates a delete from
  a write, so it gated **deletes only**: any active user could overwrite a saved bill,
  including one somebody else rang up. It now reads
  `(!data.exists() && newData.exists()) || role === 'owner'` — **create-only for a worker**.
  A biller rings a bill up and cannot touch it again; editing, splitting and deleting are all
  the owner's, enforced at the database rather than in the UI. Bills are also **shape-checked**
  now (`id`, `date`, `total`, `lines`; `total` a number, `date` a `YYYY-MM-DD` string), as are
  customers (`id` and a non-empty `name`) — a malformed record breaks every derived figure in
  the app, and there are no running totals to repair it from.

  Two consequences worth knowing. **Feature access lost two switches**: "Edit a bill" and
  "Udhari (credit)" are no longer the owner's to delegate, because both write to a saved bill
  — they moved from `GRANTABLE` to the locked list, with the reason shown in the panel. And
  the sync layer's **field-level deltas still work**, because RTDB validates the *resulting*
  record: `newData` at `shop/sales/$id` is the merge of the delta with what is stored, so a
  one-field update of a well-formed bill satisfies `hasChildren`.
- **The rules do not stop the last active owner from demoting, deactivating or deleting
  themselves.** "The owner can't lock themselves out" is true of the *app*, which refuses it —
  but the rule on `shop/users/$uid` only asks "is the actor an active owner?" and nothing
  about the state it leaves behind. RTDB rules cannot count siblings matching a predicate, so
  this is not expressible there; closing it server-side would need a maintained counter node
  or a Cloud Function. Recovery from a self-lockout is a Firebase console visit.

Neither was a privilege-escalation hole — both require an already-privileged actor, and no
worker gains anything the role matrix denies them. The first is now closed anyway; the second
stays documented rather than fixed, because RTDB cannot express it.
