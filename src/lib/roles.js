// Role-based access control for Salon Manager.
//
// This module is the SINGLE source of truth for "who may do what" in the UI. Every view
// and every action gates through `can(role, action)` — no view is role-unaware.
//
// ── Two layers, and what each one is actually worth ──────────────────────────────────
// 1. This module (UI layer): decides what renders. It is an operational control — it
//    keeps staff out of things they have no business touching. It is NOT a security
//    boundary on its own: it runs on the client, where a determined user controls it.
// 2. database.rules.json (server layer): the real boundary. It re-derives the role from
//    shop/users/<auth.uid> and enforces the genuinely sensitive slices server-side.
//
// The two MUST agree. If you add an action here, add the matching rule there.
// See the README ("Roles" + "What the role system does and does not protect") for the
// documented limits of this design.
//
// ── Three inputs, not two ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The matrix below is the DEFAULT for each role. The owner can then move individual
// features per role from Settings → Users & roles, and those choices live in
// config.permissions and arrive here as `can()`'s third argument. What they CANNOT do is
// move a feature the database would refuse anyway — see GRANTABLE.
