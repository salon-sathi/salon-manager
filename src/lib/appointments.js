// than as a timestamp. A salon books "Tuesday at 3pm", not an instant on a global timeline:
// minutes-since-midnight is exactly that, and it can't be shifted by a timezone, a DST
// boundary, or a device with the wrong clock. `date` stays a plain local YYYY-MM-DD, the same
// shape every other date in this app uses.
//
// The overlap check is the load-bearing part of this module. Double-booking a stylist is the
// mistake that actually hurts: two customers turn up at once, one waits or leaves, and the
// salon eats it. So it is pure, exhaustively tested, and checked on every write path.
