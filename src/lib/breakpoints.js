// Breakpoints — the single source for every width at which the app changes shape.
//
// Pure data and string builders: no React, no DOM. The CSS block in salon-manager.jsx, the
// useMediaQuery hook and the responsive tests all read these same numbers, so a breakpoint
// can be moved in one place instead of drifting between three hand-typed copies.
//
// The five bands are chosen from what the salon actually runs on, not from a framework's
// defaults:
//
//   phone    ≤ 599   a phone held in one hand at the counter. No room for a rail at all —
//                    navigation moves to a bottom tab bar within thumb reach.
//   tablet   600–1023 an iPad/Android tab, either orientation, and a small laptop window.
//                    Same full, labelled rail as a laptop — the rail used to collapse to icons
//                    here, but this nav's glyphs don't read on their own, so it cost a tap and
//                    a guess per navigation. The two-pane splits still stack.
//   laptop   1024–1439 the original desktop layout, unchanged.
//   desktop  1440–1919 same layout, content allowed to grow to CONTENT_MAX.
//   wide     ≥ 1920  same again; the calendar and wide tables may run past CONTENT_MAX.
//
// Note the bands are keyed on the LOWER bound of the next band up (600, 1024, …) because
// that is how `min-width` queries read; MAX_* holds the matching `max-width` value, which is
// always one pixel less. Deriving one from the other keeps a phone at exactly 600px CSS
// pixels out of both the phone and the tablet rule's overlap.
