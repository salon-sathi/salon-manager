// Customer identity and the denormalized visit/spend stats.
//
// ── Why phone is the key ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// A salon's customer record is keyed by PHONE (shop/customers/<phone>), not by a generated
// id. It is the one identifier the front desk always has, it is what a returning customer
// gives when asked, and it is what a WhatsApp reminder is sent to. That makes normalisation
// load-bearing: "+91 98765 43210", "098765 43210" and "9876543210" are the same person, and
// if they key differently the salon ends up with three of them.
//
// ── Why stats are RECOMPUTED, not incremented ───────────────────────────────────────────
// totalVisits / totalSpend / lastVisitAt are denormalized onto the customer record so the
// list and picker are cheap to render. They are always recomputed from the bills rather than
// nudged by a delta on each save. Incremental updates drift: a missed reversal on a delete, a
// bill edited on another device, a merge that lands twice — and the numbers quietly rot with
// no way to tell. Recomputing from the source of truth cannot drift, makes delete-reversal
// automatic, and costs a single pass over an in-memory array.

/**
 * Fold a name and number captured somewhere OTHER than the customer screen — typed onto a bill
 * at the till, or given by a customer on the public booking link — into the customer list.
 *
 * Returns `{ customers, record, created }`. `customers` is the same array reference when nothing
 * changed, so it drops straight into a setState without provoking a pointless sync write (same
 * contract as reconcileCustomers above).
 *
 * ── Why BOTH a name and a valid number are required ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * This is the database's rule, not a preference. A customer is KEYED by phone
 * (shop/customers/<phone>), so a record without one cannot be found again by anything; and
 * `customers/$id` in database.rules.json validates `hasChildren(['id','name'])` with
 * `name.length > 0`. Capturing a nameless or numberless walk-in would therefore build a record
 * the rules reject — a write that fails at the counter, which is exactly the failure this
 * function exists to avoid. A walk-in who gives neither stays free text on the bill, and that is
 * still a perfectly valid bill.
 *
 * ── Why an existing name is never overwritten ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The customer record is the salon's curated copy: it may have been corrected, given a fuller
 * spelling, or annotated. A name typed in a hurry at a busy till must not clobber it — the bill
 * is a worse source than the profile. A BLANK name is filled in, because that is strictly new
 * information rather than a competing version of it.
 *
 * Nothing here touches totalVisits / totalSpend / loyaltyPoints / tier. Those are derived from
 * the bills by reconcileCustomers + reconcileLoyalty, which the shell runs on the very next
 * pass — so a customer captured mid-bill arrives on the list already carrying that visit.
